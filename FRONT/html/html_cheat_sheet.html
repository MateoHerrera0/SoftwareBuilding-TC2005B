    <h1>HTML Cheat Sheet</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Hyperlinks - a</h2>
        <p>The a HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.</p>
        <p>For example: </p>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/bxlmP2biXqk">This link takes you to YouTube</a>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Paragraph - p</h2>
        <p>The p HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</p>
        <p>For example, this is written inside the p attribute.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Heading - h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6</h2>
        <p>The h1 to h6 HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. h1 is the highest section level and h6 is the lowest.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <h1>h1</h1>
        <h2>h2</h2>
        <h3>h3</h3>
        <h4>h4</h4>
        <h5>h5</h5>
        <h6>h6</h6>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Division - div</h2>
        <p>The div HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS.</p>
        <p>For example, this section is inside a div.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Span - span</h2>
        <p>The span HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes. Span is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a span is an inline element.</p>

        <span>For example, this sentence is inside the span attribute.</span>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Strong Text - strong</h2>
        <p>The strong HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.</p>
        <strong>For example, this sentence is inside the strong attribute.</strong>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Idiomatic Text - i</h2>
        <p>The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the i naming of this element.</p>
        <i>For example, this sentence is inside the i attribute.</i>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Unarticulated Annotation - u</h2>
        <p>The u HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.</p>
        <u>For example, this sentence is inside the u attribute.</u>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Bring Attention - b</h2>
        <p>The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance.</p>
        <b>For example, this sentence is inside the b attribute.</b>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Strike - strike</h2>
        <p>The strike HTML element places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.</p>
        <strike>For example, this sentence is inside the strike attribute.</strike>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Small - small</h2>
        <p>The small HTML element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font-size smaller.</p>
        <small>For example, this sentence is inside the small attribute.</small>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Emphasis - em</h2>
        <p>The em HTML element marks text that has stress emphasis. </p>
        <em>For example, this sentence is inside the em attribute.</em>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Header - header</h2>
        <p>The header HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids.</p>
        <header>
            For example, this sentence is inside the header attribute.
        </header>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Section - section</h2>
        <p>The section HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.</p>
        <section>
            For example, this sentence is inside the section attribute.
        </section>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Article - article</h2>
        <p>The article HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable.</p>
        <article>
            For example, this sentence is inside the article attribute.
        </article>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Aside - aside</h2>
        <p>The aside HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.</p>
        <aside>
            For example, this sentence is inside the aside attribute.
        </aside>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Footer - footer</h2>
        <p>The footer HTML element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. It usually goes last.</p>
        <footer>
            For example, this sentence is inside the footer attribute.
        </footer>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Navigation Section - nav</h2>
        <p>The nav HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <nav><a href="../html/html_link.html">This sentence is inside the nav attribute</a></nav>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Image - img</h2>
        <p>The img HTML element embeds an image into the document.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <img src="http://placekitten.com/200/300" alt="Kitten">
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Break - br</h2>
        <p>The br HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).</p>
        <p>For example, <br> this sentence has <br> breaks in it.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Form - form</h2>
        <p>The form HTML element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.</p>

            <input>
            <p>email input,</p>
            <input type="email">
            <p>and password input.</p>
            <input type="password">
            <br>
            <p>The textarea form.</p>
            <textarea placeholder="Write stuff here"></textarea>
            <br>
            <p>The button form.</p>
            <button>Click me</button>
        </form>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Table - table</h2>
        <p>The table HTML element represents tabular data — that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.</p>
        <p>The table is divided into three parts: The table head (thead), the table body (tbody) and the table footer (tfoot).</p>
        <p>The rows are declared with the attribute table row (tr) and the cells with the attribute table data (td).</p>
        <p>For example:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th colspan="2">Table</th>
